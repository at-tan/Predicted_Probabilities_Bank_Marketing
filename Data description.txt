Description

A Portuguese banking institution ran direct marketing campaigns to assess if clients would subscribe to a product (bank term deposit). 
The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls and more than one contact to the same client was required at times.
The goal is to predict if a client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).
